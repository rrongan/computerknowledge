				<h2>Computer Memory</h2>
				<p>Computer memory is any physical device capable of storing information temporarily or permanently.</p>

			<p>Memory can be either volatile and non-volatile memory. Volatile memory is a memory that loses its contents when the computer or hardware device loses power. Non-volatile memory is a memory that has the capability to hold saved data even if the power is turned off. The list below shows the type of memory of computer.</p>

						<h3>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h3>
						<p>Alternatively referred to as main memory, primary memory, or system memory, Random Access Memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p> 
						<p>The two widely used forms of modern RAM are static RAM (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (DRAM). In SRAM, a bit of data is stored using the state of a six transistor memory cell. This form of RAM is more expensive to produce, but is generally faster and requires less dynamic power than DRAM. In modern computers, SRAM is often used as cache memory for the CPU. DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor and capacitor pair, which together comprise a DRAM memory cell. The capacitor holds a high or low charge (1 or 0, respectively), and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of charge or change it. As this form of memory is less expensive to produce than static RAM, it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers.</p>
						<p>Both static and dynamic RAM are considered volatile, as their state is lost or reset when power is removed from the system. By contrast, read-only memory (ROM) stores data by permanently enabling or disabling selected transistors, such that the memory cannot be altered. Writeable variants of ROM (such as EEPROM and flash memory) share properties of both ROM and RAM, enabling data to persist without power and to be updated without requiring special equipment. These persistent forms of semiconductor ROM include USB flash drives, memory cards for cameras and portable devices, etc.</p>

						<h3>Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</h3>
						<p>A hard disk drive (sometimes abbreviated as Hard drive, HD, or HDD) is a non-volatile memory hardware device that permanently stores and retrieves data on a computer. A hard drive consists of one or more platters to which data is written using a magnetic head, all inside of an air-sealed casing. Internal hard disks reside in a drive bay, connect to the motherboard using an ATA, SCSI, or SATA cable, and are powered by a connection to the PSU (power supply unit).</p>
						<p>The desktop hard drive consists of the following components: the head actuator, read/write actuator arm, read/write head, spindle, and platter. On the back of a hard drive is a circuit board called the disk controller or interface board and is what allows the hard drive to communicate with the computer.</p>
						<p>An internal hard drive is connected to the computer using a data cable (IDE or SATA) that connects to the motherboard and a power cable that connects to the power supply.</p>
						<p>A hard drive can be used to store any data, including pictures, music, videos, text documents, and any files created or downloaded. Also, hard drives store files for the operating system and software programs that run on the computer.</p>
						<p>All primary computer hard drives are found inside a computer case and are attached to the computer motherboard using an ATA, SCSI, or SATA cable, and are powered by a connection to the PSU (power supply unit).</p>

						<h3>Solid-State Drive (SSD)</h3>
						<p>Solid-State Drive is a drive that uses non-volatile memory as a means of storing and accessing data, much like computer RAM. SSDs have no moving mechanical components. This distinguishes them from traditional electromechanical magnetic disks such as hard disk drives (HDDs) or floppy disks, which contain spinning disks and movable read/write heads.</p> 
						<p>Compared with electromechanical disks, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock, run silently, and have lower access time and lower latency. However, while the price of SSDs has continued to decline over time (24 cents per gb as of 2017), consumer-grade SSDs are (as of 2017) still roughly four times more expensive per unit of storage than consumer-grade HDDs.</p>
						<p>As of 2015, most SSDs use MLC NAND-based flash memory, which is a type of non-volatile memory that retains data when power is lost. For applications requiring fast access but not necessarily data persistence after power loss, SSDs may be constructed from random-access memory (RAM). Such devices may employ batteries as integrated power sources to retain data for a certain amount of time after external power is lost.</p>

							<h3>Facts of RAM</h3>
						</header>
						<ul class="default">
							<li>Different kinds of RAM usually will not work together in the same computer. Most computers can only use one kind of RAM. Some can use a small number of different kinds. Different kinds of RAM often have differently shaped connectors. This limits which RAM chips a particular computer model can use.</li>
							<li>The first form of RAM came about in 1947 with the use of the Williams tube. It utilized a cathode ray tube (CRT) and data was stored on the face of the CRT as electrically charged spots.</li>
							<li>RAM as we know it today, as solid state memory, was first invented in 1968 by Robert Dennard. Known specifically as dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, transistors were used to store bits of data.</li>

							<h3>Facts of HDD</h3>
						</header>
						<ul class="default">
							<li>IBM Model 350 Disk File, the first hard drive, was created by IBM in 1956.  The hard drive was made from 50 discs. The whole thing was as big as a regular table. The capacity of the hard drive was 5 MB. The price was USD 3200.</li>
							<li>The hard drives reached 1 TB (1000GB) storage capacity in 2007. Two years later the maximal capacity was doubled.</li>
							<li>The first hard drive over 1GB was made by IBM in 1980.  The model was IBM 3380 and had 2.52 GB storage surface.  The hard drive was pretty damn big. The device loked like a refrigerator and weighted 250kg. </li>
							<li>The first commercial hard drive (5MB) was made by Apple in 1981 and was available for USD 3200.</li>

							<h3>Facts of SSD</h3>
						</header>
						<ul class="default">
							<li>The first SSD was implemented in IBM supercomputers in the 1970s and 1980s. They have since been drastically improved upon and offer storage capacities of over 500 GB for home computers. </li>
							<li>As the costs of SSD storage per GB have continued to decrease, these drives have become suitable replacements for a standard hard drive in desktop and laptop computers. SSDs are also a great solution for netbooks, nettops, and other applications that don't require several hundred GB of space.</li>
							<li>Hybrid drives or solid-state hybrid drives (SSHDs) combine the features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit, containing a large hard disk drive and an SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data.</li>
